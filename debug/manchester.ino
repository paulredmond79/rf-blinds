 These are just raw test dumps. The data has to be processed and require 10-11 bytes for all the packet to be seen
 Oregon Scientific works on nibbles and these need to reversed ie ABCD become DCBA in each nibble
 Also the OS protocol has a simple checksum to assist with validation as the packets are only sent once a cycle
